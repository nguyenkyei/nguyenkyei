# Hi, I'm Kyei 👋

**Finance Engineer · Accounting Analytics (GL → PL → BS → Decision)**  
Creator of **GL Risk Darkboard** (HTML + Python). I build lightweight, offline-friendly dashboards for accounting teams in proxy-restricted environments.

## Featured Projects
- 🔥 **[QUANT-ACC-SAP](https://github.com/nguyenkyei/QUANT-ACC-SAP)** — tools & dashboards for GL/BS/PL analytics (mapping, risk scoring, JSON export).
- 📊 **GL Darkboard** (private for now) — HTML dashboards (donut/line/heatmap) with JSON inputs, no backend required.

## Tech
Python · Django · Pandas · NumPy · SQLite/PostgreSQL · HTML/CSS/JS

## What I'm working on
- Building **accounting insights** from **GL, BS, PL** data (risk scoring, trends, KPIs).  
- Studying **CFA** and applying financial ratios to company dashboards.  
- Moving ETL from **Excel → SQLite** for cleaner lineage and reproducible pipelines.

## Collaboration
- I’m looking to collaborate on **corporate finance analytics** and **ERP-lite dashboards**.  
- Open to issues/PRs on data mapping, risk models, and visualization.

- 🧪 Sandbox repos: check my pins below.

## Fun fact
I once merged three separate GL/BS/PL HTML dashboards into a single tabbed page so it runs **offline** behind a strict proxy 😅
